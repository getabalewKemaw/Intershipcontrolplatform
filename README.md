## Overview

The Internship Control Platform is designed to serve three main actors:

- **Students/Applicants:** Can create profiles, browse and apply for internships.
- **Companies/Employers:** Can post internship opportunities and manage applicants.
- **Admins:** Can oversee the platform, verify postings, and manage users.

A key feature is the AI-based matching system that intelligently suggests the best internship opportunities to applicants based on their profiles, skills, and interests.

---

## Architecture

This is a **client-side web application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The AI matching logic is written in JavaScript and runs in the browser.

**Note:** There is no server or backend implementation in this repo. All data is stored in the browser (using localStorage or similar) or mocked for demonstration purposes. For a real-world deployment, backend integration would be required.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structure and markup
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Application logic, interactivity, and AI matching
- **[Optional/Pluggable]**: AI logic can be extended to integrate with server-side APIs or external AI services

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getabalewKemaw/Intershipcontrolplatform.git
cd Intershipcontrolplatform
```

### 2. Open in Browser

Simply open `index.html` with your preferred web browser:

- Double-click `index.html`
- Or use a local HTTP server:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server
  # Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
  ```

### 3. (Optional) Customization

- Edit files in `/css/` to change styling
- Update `/js/matching.js` to refine the AI matching logic

---

## Usage Guide

### For Students

1. Register an account (register.html)
2. Complete your profile with skills, interests, and education
3. Browse internships or view AI-powered recommendations
4. Apply to internships and track your status on the dashboard

### For Companies

1. Register as a company (register.html, select company role)
2. Create your company profile
3. Post new internships
4. View applicants and manage postings

### For Admins

- Use the admin dashboard to review activity, approve/reject posts, and manage users

## AI Matching Logic

The AI-based matching is handled in `js/matching.js`. The core approach is as follows:

1. **Profile Analysis:** Student skills, interests, and education are parsed and weighted.
2. **Internship Analysis:** Each internship is scored based on required skills, location, and other criteria.
3. **Scoring & Ranking:** The matching system calculates compatibility scores and ranks internships for each applicant.
4. **Recommendation:** Top matches are shown to the user.

> **Note:** The current implementation is rules-based and runs in the browser. For production, consider using machine learning models and server-side computation.
